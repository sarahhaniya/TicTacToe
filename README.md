# TicTacToe
This project involved designing and implementing a digital version of Tic Tac Toe on an FPGA platform, leveraging the DE10-Standard board with an ARM Cortex-A9 processor. The game features a real-time interactive interface with keyboard controls, displaying game state, player moves, and a scoreboard on an external VGA monitor. Using interrupt-driven input handling and efficient algorithms, the project demonstrates embedded systems design in a gaming context, focusing on user experience and performance optimization. This work highlights the adaptability of embedded computing for interactive applications.
